## NMAP Output File to Discover if IP:PORT is Web Site
- Proxy to Burp Suite to map the Web Servers (proxy is hard coded in the `ip_http_request.py` script)
https://github.com/awillard1/nmap_utils/tree/main
- use nmap with -oX

```
python3 nmap_hosts_ports.py --filepath nmap-output/out.xml | python3 ip_http_request.py
```
  
### NOTE:  
  
If `GoLang` is installed, you could use `httpx` or `httprobe` instead of `ip_http_request.py`

There is a `.Net` version of the `nmap_hosts_ports.py` if `python3` is not installed on windows. Currently there is no equivalent to `ip_http_request.py` as `GoLang` or `Curl` could also be used on windows.
