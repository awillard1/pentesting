## NMAP Output File
https://github.com/awillard1/nmap_utils/tree/main
- use nmap with -oX

`python3 nmap_hosts_ports.py --filepath nmap-output/out.xml | python3 ip_http_request.py`



If `GoLang` is installed, use `httpx` or `httprobe` instead of `ip_http_request.py`

There is a `.Net` version of the `nmap_hosts_ports.py` if `python3` is not installed on windows. Currently there is no equivalent to `ip_http_request.py` as `GoLang` or `Curl` could also be used on windows.
